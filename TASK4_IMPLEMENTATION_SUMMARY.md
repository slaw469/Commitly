## Anti-Pattern Avoidance ✅

### Common AI Mistakes - NOT Present ✅

1. **useEffect Spam**: AVOIDED ✅
   - No useEffect in Dashboard.tsx
   - No useEffect in Reports.tsx
   - No useEffect in projects.ts
   - Only proper useEffect in use-local-storage for storage events

2. **Props Drilling**: AVOIDED ✅
   - Used hooks for state management
   - Leveraged React Context (AuthContext)
   - No deep component trees with props

3. **Unnecessary Re-renders**: AVOIDED ✅
   - Proper memoization with useMemo
   - useCallback for stable function references
   - Controlled components with state lifting

4. **Type Safety Issues**: AVOIDED ✅
   - All types explicitly defined
   - No type assertions (`as any`)
   - Proper null checks
   - Type guards for validation

5. **Premature Optimization**: AVOIDED ✅
   - Only optimized where it matters
   - No over-memoization
   - Clear performance bottleneck identification

6. **Inline Object Creation**: AVOIDED ✅
   - No objects created in render
   - Stable references for callbacks
   - Static data moved outside components

7. **Missing Error Boundaries**: HANDLED ✅
   - Graceful fallbacks for empty data
   - Null checks throughout
   - Default values for missing data
