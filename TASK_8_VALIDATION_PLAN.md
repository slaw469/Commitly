# Task 8: Definition of Done (MVP) - Validation Plan

## Overview

This document validates that all MVP requirements are met and the system is production-ready.

## Validation Criteria

### 1. CLI Functionality ✅

**Requirement:** CLI lints and blocks bad commits via commit-msg hook

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] CLI builds successfully without errors
- [ ] `commitly lint` command validates commit messages
- [ ] `commitly fix` command auto-fixes messages
- [ ] `commitly check` command works for CI/CD
- [ ] `commitly init-hooks` installs git hooks correctly
- [ ] Git hook blocks invalid commits
- [ ] Git hook allows valid commits
- [ ] Config files are loaded correctly (.commitlyrc.json, package.json)
- [ ] Colorized output displays properly
- [ ] Exit codes are correct (0 for success, 1 for failure)

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Build CLI
cd packages/commitly-cli && pnpm build

# Test lint command
echo "invalid message" > test-msg.txt
commitly lint -f test-msg.txt  # Should fail
echo "feat: valid message" > test-msg.txt
commitly lint -f test-msg.txt  # Should pass

# Test fix command
echo "Fix bug in parser." > test-msg.txt
commitly fix -f test-msg.txt   # Should auto-fix

# Test check command
commitly check "feat: test message"  # Should pass
commitly check "invalid message"     # Should fail

# Test hook installation
cd /tmp/test-repo && git init
commitly init-hooks
# Try invalid commit - should be blocked
# Try valid commit - should succeed
```

### 2. Web Playground Functionality ✅

**Requirement:** Web playground validates & shows auto-fix suggestion with diff

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Web app builds successfully for production
- [ ] Development server starts without errors

cd apps/commitly-web && pnpm build

# Start dev server
pnpm dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
# Test various commit messages
```

**Manual Tests:**
1. Enter: "Add new feature" → Should show errors and suggest "feat: add new feature"
2. Enter: "feat: Add Feature." → Should show case and period errors
3. Enter: "feat: valid message" → Should show success
4. Test diff view with auto-fix
5. Test copy button functionality
6. Test dark theme toggle
7. Test responsive design

### 3. Presets Functionality ✅

- [ ] Import preset from JSON file works
- [ ] Imported presets are validated
- [ ] Invalid preset JSON shows error
- [ ] Preset configuration applies to validation

**Manual Tests:**
1. Create preset with custom types: ["custom", "special"]
2. Save preset as "Custom Config"
3. Reload page
4. Verify preset still exists
5. Export preset to JSON
6. Delete preset
7. Import preset from JSON
8. Verify imported config works

- [ ] Build output is optimized
- [ ] All assets are properly bundled
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] No build errors
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] Bundle sizes are reasonable
