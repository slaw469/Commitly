## Validation Checks Performed

### 1. Linting
✅ All files pass ESLint with zero errors
✅ No console.log statements in production code
✅ Proper TypeScript types throughout

### 2. React Best Practices
✅ No useEffect infinite loops
✅ Proper dependency arrays in all hooks
✅ Cleanup functions in all useEffect hooks
✅ Memoization with useMemo and useCallback where appropriate
✅ No side effects in useMemo
✅ Proper error boundaries and error handling
✅ Loading states prevent layout shift

### 3. Performance
✅ Debounced validation (150ms)
✅ Memoized expensive computations
✅ Skeleton loaders prevent CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
✅ Lazy state initialization where appropriate
✅ Refs used to prevent stale closures
✅ isMounted checks prevent state updates after unmount

### 4. Accessibility (WCAG AA Standards)
✅ All interactive elements have accessible names
✅ Proper focus management and visible focus indicators
✅ Keyboard navigation fully supported
✅ Screen reader announcements for state changes
✅ Proper ARIA attributes throughout
✅ Semantic HTML elements used correctly
✅ Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
✅ Loading states properly announced

### 5. Error Handling
✅ Try-catch blocks around all async operations
✅ User-friendly error messages
✅ Toast notifications for all operations
✅ Proper error state management
✅ Graceful degradation on failures

### 6. UX Improvements
✅ Loading skeletons prevent layout shift
✅ Toast notifications provide immediate feedback
✅ Loading indicators on all async operations
✅ Disabled states clearly indicated
✅ Success/error states visually distinct
✅ Keyboard shortcuts documented

## Common AI Mistakes Avoided

### 1. useEffect Issues
❌ Avoided: Infinite loops from missing dependencies
✅ Implemented: Proper dependency arrays in all useEffect hooks
✅ Implemented: Cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks
✅ Implemented: isMounted refs to prevent state updates after unmount

### 2. Performance Issues
❌ Avoided: Unnecessary re-renders
✅ Implemented: useMemo for expensive computations
✅ Implemented: useCallback for stable function references
✅ Implemented: Debouncing for validation

### 3. Accessibility Issues
❌ Avoided: Missing ARIA labels
❌ Avoided: Decorative icons without aria-hidden
❌ Avoided: Interactive elements without keyboard support
✅ Implemented: Comprehensive ARIA attributes
✅ Implemented: Keyboard navigation support
✅ Implemented: Screen reader announcements

### 4. State Management
❌ Avoided: useState spam
❌ Avoided: Prop drilling
✅ Implemented: Custom hooks for shared state
✅ Implemented: Context for auth state
✅ Implemented: localStorage integration
